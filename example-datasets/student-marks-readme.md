# Student Marks

A fictitious dataset of student marks.

There are 9 columns (dimensions): the name of each student and their marks from 0
to 100 in each of 8 subjects (Maths, English, PE, Art, History, IT,
Biology, and German).

After the header row, there are 30 rows of data (records) representing
30 students.

The dataset has been carefully curated to contain some outliers and
some interesting patterns. For example, try to check the hypothesis
that student who are good in one language will also be good in another
language.
